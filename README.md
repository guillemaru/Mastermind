# Mastermind
Welcome to mastermind!  
This is a game where you have to guess a hidden combination  of four colours, between these: red, yellow, green, blue, orange and purple.  If you guess a colour, you will have a white ball, and if you guess a colour  and its position, you will have a black ball. You win if you have 4 black  balls before 7 attempts.

- In part 1, the hidden combination is created and you try to guess it
